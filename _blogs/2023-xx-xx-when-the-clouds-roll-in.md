_The clouds after a storm, taken from my balcony back in Scarborough, 2018._

Originally, when I finished reading Andrew Root's book, _[The Pastor in a Secular Age](https://www.andrewroot.org/the-pastor-in-a-secular-age/)_, I was going to write a blog under this title to reflect on my takeaways from that book. Well over a year later, and after finishing another two of his books, I have even more thoughts on ministry in the secular age!  
While I'm no expert, and I'll definitely fumble trying to explain things as well as Root does in his books, I think that this is such an amazing topic worth looking into (though I definitely recommend reading his books on this topic if you're very interested — and if you do, I'd love to chat with you more)! Instead with this blog, I'll point out some convictions I have about ministry moving forward, along with what that looks like in practice.

# Book 2 - [The Pastor in a Secular Age](https://www.andrewroot.org/the-pastor-in-a-secular-age/)

This book came to me at the right time, when I became very involved with the youth ministry at the church I went to in Mississauga. It was very clear that the way the kids could be ministered to was very different than how I was ministered to. I wondered, _"Am I really fit to do this?"_, as I often struggled to relate to the kids and speak gospel truth to them. It always felt like nothing stuck and resonated with them, and that we as a leadership team were **chasing after the next best thing** to get them excited about Jesus.

As I read this book, I realized, _"Yeah, I don't have what it takes to make these kids believe in their hearts and live it out in their lives!"_ The truth is, there is nothing we can say or do to cause people to believe. That is completely up to God! So then,_"What exactly do pastors (or ministers, to that extent) do?"_ you might wonder.

Root talked a lot in his book about the history of specific pastors and how the approach of ministry has changed overtime, and it's quite fascinating to read! In the second half of his book, he gave a few answers about how ministry _actually_ looks like to a people who believe they don't need God (read, secular age), taking inspiration from the bible itself!

He emphasizes that God must move and act in people's lives first for there to be a heart change (there's obviously a lot more details in his book on this, which is why I recommend reading it). It's this action that God does as an act of ministry, and He then calls the ministered-to to now minister to others, sharing in how God has acted in their lives. But of course, there is nothing we can do to stir up God to do His necessary action!

## Takeaways

So then, what is a pastor/minister? My belief is that a pastor/minister is akin to farmer, who faithfully sows seeds in the ground, and watches the clouds in anticipation for the rain to come. While the farmer cannot control when it rains, he is however, able to tell when it does, from his extensive experience in the fields. Similarly, a pastor/minister faithfully preaches the word, and watches and waits with his people for God to act in their lives with much anticipation.

Prayer follows this exact shape of faithfully waiting on the LORD, and is therefore the primary form of ministry, as our way of watching the clouds and waiting for the rain to come down. And when it does rain, we can say, _"Look! God has come and acted!"_, sharing with amazement in our eyes!

> I saw in the night visions, and behold, with the clouds of heaven there came one like a son of man, and he came to the Ancient of Days and was presented before him. And to him was given dominion and glory and a kingdom, that all peoples, nations, and languages should serve him; his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom one that shall not be destroyed. (Daniel 7:13–14, ESV)

Will you join me in prayer with and for others as we wait on the LORD to minister and change people's hearts and lives?
