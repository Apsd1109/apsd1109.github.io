> But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world. (Galatians 6:14, KJV 1900)

I wanted to share more casually (before I release yet another lengthy, serious article), reflecting on the past 5 years, especially just having graduated. And for those who are curious, no I haven't switched to using KJV; it's just that I was recently listening to some [sermons from Dr. Martyn Lloyd Jones](https://www.mljtrust.org/sermons/other-sermons/glorying-only-in-the-cross/), and I cannot un-hear Gal. 6:14 in KJV (it does sound more epic though, "God forbid...!").

# Boasting in the LORD

In the recent year, right before graduating, I went through some tougher books of the Bible (Revelation, and numerous prophets). In my slow read-through, I have found great joy in knowing God and His promises through the revealed Word, particularly through lesser-known passages! This was apparent especially during some very tough times (e.g., searching for full-time work, or juggling school and ministry while trying to do them with excellence). In those times, I found that the words from Jeremiah ring true:

> Thus says the LORD: "Let not the wise man boast in his wisdom, let not the mighty man boast in his might, let not the rich man boast in his riches, but let him who boasts boast in this, **that he understands and knows me**, that I am the LORD who practices steadfast love, justice, and righteousness in the earth. For in these things I delight, declares the LORD." (Jeremiah 9:23â€“24, ESV)

So then, I would encourage fellow believers to cherish in knowing and understanding God, both in good times, and in bad. There are great riches to be found in His WordðŸ’Ž.

# The Providing Hand of God

Throughout all of my undergrad, my co-op searches have been very rough. While my peers netted themselves 10+ interviews, I struggled to even get one. And this has been characteristic of **all six** of my co-op terms. The most I received in a term is three (if my memory isn't failing me)! During my first co-op, I secured my job the day before my final exam; in my second, while I had a few more interviews, I failed to land a job with interests that aligned with mine; yet in my third, I managed to pivot within the same company, gaining relevant experience and great praise from my teammates and manager; in my fourth, I took a gamble on a company that regarded me well, but hadn't given an explicit job offer (there's a whole ranking system that UWaterloo has), which ended up being one of my most memorable and growing periods; leading to my fifth job, which was with a very prestigious company in the US (yet, that was the only interview I had).

So then, everything came crumbling down when I was denied a return offer for my final co-op. At the time, the economy was in a downturn, and so everyone blamed it on the circumstances. While I desperately wanted to return to the States (Seattle in particular), I reluctantly settled for my only interview and offer, which was back in Toronto. I was offered a very low salary (one much lower than even my fourth co-op), but managed to negotiate that upwards to be my second-highest-earning co-op placement. And in the end, the work experience was wonderful!

During this time however, I was searching for my full-time job (I actually started towards the end of August, 2023). I was flip-flopping between wanting to be in Seattle, to being okay with being where friends were in the US (e.g., San Francisco, Boston, etc.), to Toronto, to "anywhere, so long as there was good work." Hundreds upon hundreds of applications were sent, and I was only met with a small handful of interviews (less than five), all of which resulted in nothing.

By the time I graduated in April, I was very desperate, as I wanted to make use of my time by working instead of wasting it away ([Eph. 5:15-16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%205%3A15-16&version=ESV)). I even tried to reach out to former managers for leads, but to no avail. So come June, I wanted to reach out to the HR of my previous company in Seattle, just to make sure that I was still on their waitlist for return offers (you can never fully trust HR ðŸ™ƒ). Well, I never did, as I just procrastinated and dreaded sending that email. However, I was met with great surprise as a return offer from them popped into my inbox out of nowhere! At the time, I was actually at a BBQ dinner with my church, and decided to check my phone in the corner of the room â€” I was left with my mouth gaping wide open, hoping that no one else saw me or tried to talk to me, as I would have struggled to find any words with which to respond.

As I fired off text messages to my parents, "I GOT A RETURN OFFER!!", and later met with them, we were all just shocked as to how sudden this came to be (and also shocked with respect to the compensation offered). I genuinely didn't expect to hear from them until much later in the year (say, November 2024).

I quickly accepted the offer (as it was my only one, once again), and decided on a start date in September, so that I could have more time with family and friends (I essentially had a four-month vacation). Looking back on all of this, all I can say is that this was all the provision of God!

God truly provides for His children, and more often than not, with great generosity:

> Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shadow due to change. (James 1:17, ESV)

> And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose. (Romans 8:28, ESV)

# Looking to the Unknown Future

> but when they had grazed, they became full, they were filled, and their heart was lifted up; therefore they forgot me. (Hosea 13:6, ESV)

Now that I've moved to Seattle (yes, I did write a large portion of this blog on the flight over, once again), and about to start work, it's easy to look to my own efforts and not give God His due praise. It's especially easy when the job I have compensates excessively well and instead of praising Him, I rely solely on myself to try and plan the rest of my future.

The truth is, I have no ability to ordain the things of the future. What I desire might not necessarily be what God has set in time:

> The heart of man plans his way, but the LORD establishes his steps. (Proverbs 16:9, ESV)

A lesson I learned during my final year of undergrad was this: that everyone has their own life to live, and thus, there is no room for envy/covetousness.

Observing my peers at school and work, I quickly realized that while we're quick to be envious of another person's accomplishments or gifts, we don't recognize the hardship that they currently face or had to go through. For example, I could never imagine living in a foreign country, working to support my family back home, while constantly worrying about whether I'm performing enough to avoid being fired/laid off. Everyone has their own burdens to bear.

So then, as I look to the future, I really don't know what exactly is to come. But as I wade through the unknown, I know that I get to enjoy being with the LORD every step of the way, fully safe in the shadow of His wings, praising His name all the day long.
