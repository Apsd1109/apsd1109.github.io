"Simon son of John, do you love me more than these?"  
"Yes, Lord, you know that I love you."  
"Feed my lambs."

"Simon son of John, do you love me?"  
"Yes, Lord, you know that I love you."  
"Take care of my sheep."

"Simon son of John, do you love me?"  
"Lord, you know all things; you know that I love you."  
"Feed my sheep.  
Very truly I tell you, when you were younger,  
You dressed yourself and went where you wanted;  
But when you are old, you will stretch out your hands,  
And someone else will dress you and lead you where you do not want to go.  
Follow me!"

"Lord, what about him?"

"If I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you?"

Now that we are on the other side of the cross,  
What do we say? What do we do?  
Do we respond by going back to what is comfortable and safe for our own sake?  
Are we going to be distracted by how others will respond?  
Or,  
Will we lay down our lives for the sake of Christ,  
Pouring out ourselves for the advancement of His kingdom,  
The same way Jesus did on that cross?

The hope that we have is that  
We have been saved and freed from  
The shackles of sin and death,  
Because of Jesus’ sacrifice.  
We have been saved for  
God’s purpose and mission of redemption,  
Here and right now!

Follow Jesus,  
Because He is risen!  
Happy Easter!
