In the book of Revelation, John, the author of the book, has extensive visions of being in heaven, interacting with Jesus, angels, and other heavenly beings. In chapters two and three, Jesus addresses seven churches: He commends, rebukes, exhorts them to change, and provides both promises and consequences for those who do and don't change. What Jesus says to those seven churches can tell us a lot about how we should see (and evaluate) churches. Even across the entire New Testament, we can see both positive and negative examples of what solid churches look like, and those help us decide what church to take part in and belong to, no matter where we find ourselves.

With this blog, I'll cover a few items, all focusing on how to discern what church to join — namely, the book of Revelation, New Testament churches and their "one-anothers", and I'll close off with some application and resources.

# Revelation's Seven Churches

## Ephesus: Pure doctrine, yet lacking love

> I know your works, your toil and your patient endurance, and how you cannot bear with those who are evil, but have tested those who call themselves apostles and are not, and found them to be false. I know you are enduring patiently and bearing up for my name’s sake, and you have not grown weary. But I have this against you, that you have abandoned the love you had at first. (Revelation 2:2–4, ESV)

The church in Ephesus was commended for working patiently, being discerning, and keeping their doctrine pure. This is good, as we are recommended to test things according to the word of God. If they are not in line, they are to be thrown out. Allowing false teaching to remain steers people into sin; and sin, if allowed to fester, destroys absolutely everything.

> Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, for many false prophets have gone out into the world. (1 John 4:1, ESV)

> If anyone teaches a different doctrine and does not agree with the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ and the teaching that accords with godliness, he is puffed up with conceit and understands nothing. He has an unhealthy craving for controversy and for quarrels about words, which produce envy, dissension, slander, evil suspicions, and constant friction among people who are depraved in mind and deprived of the truth, imagining that godliness is a means of gain. (1 Timothy 6:3–5, ESV)

> Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump? Cleanse out the old leaven that you may be a new lump, as you really are unleavened. (1 Corinthians 5:6b–7a, ESV)

However, chasing doctrine solely as a mechanical act of the mind, for the purposes of knowledge in and of itself, is not good. There is no competition for which church has the most correct doctrine, for we are all human, and therefore cannot comprehend the infinite depth of God. That isn't to say that we should give up completely on having correct doctrine! By no means! In fact, I would say that it is good to be continuously evaluating, dare I say, _reforming ourselves_, according to Scripture. Correct doctrine helps us to know God more fully, and therefore, worship Him, and live in right relationship with Him more richly.

What I imagine the church in Ephesus did, was chase after doctrine itself completely missing the reason why they should keep their doctrine pure. They lost their first love: Jesus Christ Himself! It's a joy to worship God, and sound teaching helps us do that even more greatly!

## Smyrna: Spiritually rich and enduring persecution

> I know your tribulation and your poverty (but you are rich) and the slander of those who say that they are Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan. Do not fear what you are about to suffer. Behold, the devil is about to throw some of you into prison, that you may be tested, and for ten days you will have tribulation. Be faithful unto death, and I will give you the crown of life. (Revelation 2:9–10, ESV)

The church in Smyrna is one of the two churches that Jesus only commends in the book of Revelation. They went through poverty and tribulation, yet endured. So Jesus encourages them to continue to, "be faithful unto death", as He will reward them richly (giving them the crown of life).

> For God, who said, "Let light shine out of darkness," has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. But we have this treasure in jars of clay, to show that the surpassing power belongs to God and not to us. We are afflicted in every way, but not crushed; perplexed, but not driven to despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed; always carrying in the body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be manifested in our bodies. For we who live are always being given over to death for Jesus’ sake, so that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh. (2 Corinthians 4:6–11, ESV)
> But he said to me, "My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness. Therefore I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may rest upon me. (2 Corinthians 12:9, ESV)

A church filled with joyful people is a beauty, but a church filled with broken, yet clinging to Christ is an even greater beauty! God's people aren't uniform in experiences and personalities. Instead, what makes the church amazing is that despite being irregular, broken, and discoloured scraps, we're put together like a mosaic. When you zoom out, you'll see the unifying beauty of God's grace and wisdom! This glorifies God!

> and to bring to light for everyone what is the plan of the mystery hidden for ages in God, who created all things, so that through the church the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places. (Ephesians 3:9–10, ESV)

## Pergamum: Holding to Christ, yet holding false teaching

> I know where you dwell, where Satan’s throne is. Yet you hold fast my name, and you did not deny my faith even in the days of Antipas my faithful witness, who was killed among you, where Satan dwells. But I have a few things against you: you have some there who hold the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to put a stumbling block before the sons of Israel, so that they might eat food sacrificed to idols and practice sexual immorality. (Revelation 2:13–14, ESV)

The church in Pergamum was commended by Jesus, as they held to Him and didn't deny His name despite severe persecution. Yet, they allowed false teaching to creep into their congregation, tainting the purity of God's people. For the purposes of keeping this brief, I'll refer you back to [the church in Ephesus](#ephesus-pure-doctrine-yet-lacking-love) and [the church in Smyrna](#smyrna-spiritually-rich-and-enduring-persecution) as the church in Pergamum experienced a combination of the two.

## Thyatira: Growing in love, yet tolerating heresy

> I know your works, your love and faith and service and patient endurance, and that your latter works exceed the first. But I have this against you, that you tolerate that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess and is teaching and seducing my servants to practice sexual immorality and to eat food sacrificed to idols. (Revelation 2:19–20, ESV)

The church in Thyatria is like the opposite of [the church in Ephesus](#ephesus-pure-doctrine-yet-lacking-love). They didn't just love, but they **grew in love** (their "latter works exceeded their first"). Solid churches aren't merely filled by the love of God, but they also continuously grow in love.

However, they **tolerated heresy**. Nowadays, there are many "churches" that prop up themselves as being very welcoming, to the point of allowing heretical teaching to run rampant in their church. Continuing on in Revelation 2, Jesus has a special warning for them:

> I gave her time to repent, but she refuses to repent of her sexual immorality. Behold, I will throw her onto a sickbed, and those who commit adultery with her I will throw into great tribulation, unless they repent of her works, and I will strike her children dead. And all the churches will know that I am he who searches mind and heart, and I will give to each of you according to your works. (Revelation 2:21–23, ESV)

The call to action is quite clear, to repent of sin. Being part of a church that is **actively rebelling against God** will not be good for your soul, so stay away!

## Sardis: Lifeless, dead works

> I know your works. You have the reputation of being alive, but you are dead. Wake up, and strengthen what remains and is about to die, for I have not found your works complete in the sight of my God. (Revelation 3:1a–2, ESV)

The church in Sardis is one of two churches which Jesus only rebukes. Jesus gives a stern warning and call to action, "Wake up, and strengthen what remains". What is deceptive about churches like the one in Sardis, is that on the surface, they seem lively (read, full of activity), yet on the inside, within their congregation, they are dead (read, lacking in abundance of life). I personally am weary of churches that heavily promote running countless activities to attract people to their church, as what often happens is that the spiritual liveliness of the congregation is sacrificed. Their reliance on themselves is exalted and their reliance on God is diminished, for they're merely interested in raising their own banner, promoting "a new \<INSERT CHURCH NAME OR CITY HERE\>", instead of fixing their eyes on **the New Jerusalem**. I won't ramble on anymore, since [I did that in an earlier blog](2023-04-29-when-the-clouds-roll-in.md), sharing my takeaways from a bunch of books on the topic of "ministry in the secular age", which I highly recommend you check out if you are interested in this particular topic.

## Philadelphia: Keeping God's word and never denying Jesus

> I know your works. Behold, I have set before you an open door, which no one is able to shut. I know that you have but little power, and yet you have kept my word and have not denied my name. Behold, I will make those of the synagogue of Satan who say that they are Jews and are not, but lie—behold, I will make them come and bow down before your feet, and they will learn that I have loved you. Because you have kept my word about patient endurance, I will keep you from the hour of trial that is coming on the whole world, to try those who dwell on the earth. (Revelation 3:8–10, ESV)

The church in Philadelphia is another church that Jesus only commends. They have kept to God's word and didn't deny Jesus; they patiently endured. And so Jesus tells them to continue on, and they will be greatly rewarded!

> I am coming soon. Hold fast what you have, so that no one may seize your crown. The one who conquers, I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God. Never shall he go out of it, and I will write on him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which comes down from my God out of heaven, and my own new name. (Revelation 3:11–12, ESV)

## Laodicea: Lukewarm, wretched

> I know your works: you are neither cold nor hot. Would that you were either cold or hot! So, because you are lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, I will spit you out of my mouth. For you say, I am rich, I have prospered, and I need nothing, not realizing that you are wretched, pitiable, poor, blind, and naked. I counsel you to buy from me gold refined by fire, so that you may be rich, and white garments so that you may clothe yourself and the shame of your nakedness may not be seen, and salve to anoint your eyes, so that you may see. (Revelation 3:15–18, ESV)

The church in Laodicea is the final church that Jesus mentions. This church is the other church that Jesus only rebukes. And the rebuke is very heavy. They are identified as useless (being neither hot, nor cold), full of pride (not relying on God), and blind (not realizing their wretchedness, nakedness). Churches that are useless for the ministry of the gospel are disowned by Jesus (for He will spit them out), which is a very terrible thing (see [Matthew 25:31-46](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+25%3A31-46&version=ESV)). Make sure that you and the church you attend aren't described like the church in Laodicea!

# New Testament Churches

The NT is **filled** with positive and negative examples of what the church **should** look like. Before I dive into that, I think it's very important to first recognize the importance of the church, and tackle the ever-elusive idea of "a perfect church".

## The Importance of the Church

We first must recognize that the church is part of God's plan of redemption for the world. It's by the joint effort of the Holy Spirit and man, that the world comes to know the truth about Christ, repent of their sins, put their trust in Jesus, and be saved! There are many calls to Christians to be faithful, so that the world would benefit!

> But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for his own possession, that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light. Once you were not a people, but now you are God’s people; once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy. Beloved, I urge you as sojourners and exiles to abstain from the passions of the flesh, which wage war against your soul. Keep your conduct among the Gentiles honorable, so that when they speak against you as evildoers, **they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day of visitation**. (1 Peter 2:9–12, ESV)
> And you became imitators of us and of the Lord, for you received the word in much affliction, with the joy of the Holy Spirit, so that **you became an example to all the believers in Macedonia and in Achaia. For not only has the word of the Lord sounded forth from you in Macedonia and Achaia, but your faith in God has gone forth everywhere**, so that we need not say anything. For they themselves report concerning us the kind of reception we had among you, and how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God, and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, Jesus who delivers us from the wrath to come. (1 Thessalonians 1:6–10, ESV)

Even Christ Himself **died** for the church! Jesus, the groom, died for His bride!! This is serious stuff. So, we must have a high view of the church.

> as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her, that he might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word, so that he might present the church to himself in splendor, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, that she might be holy and without blemish. (Ephesians 5:25b–27, ESV)

## Perfect Church?

Yet, we must remember that the church, as a particular gathered group of imperfect Christians, cannot be perfect! There is no such thing as a perfect church on earth. Charles Spurgeon himself says:

> If I had never joined a church till I had found one that was perfect, I should never have joined one at all. And the moment I did join it, if I had found one, I should have spoiled it, for it would not have been a perfect church after I had become a member of it. Still, imperfect as it is, it is the dearest place on earth to us. - Charles Spurgeon

And so we must balance the two: the church is very important, and at the same time, not perfect! But we must still belong to a church.

## Aside: "The" vs. "A" Church

Before continuing on, I want to clarify by saying that the phrase, "a church" refers to a **local** church. That is, a particular group of Christians, gathered in a particular place, in a particular time. It's a specific group of people in a specific locality. On the other hand, "the church" refers to the **universal** church. That is, all of God's people around the world.

Now you might refute the idea of belonging to a church, on the basis of it not being perfect, believing that you are already in "the universal church", or believing that you can "be the church online", and therefore conclude that you don't need to belong to a church. Such a view is erroneous.

It's quite simple really. In the NT, we see lots of commands to Christians in a **local** church context. In other words, by not belonging to a local church, you are not fulfilling God's commands, and therefore you are disobedient! Yes, all Christians belong to God's **universal** church. Beautiful as it is, it is meant to be expressed in the **locality** of the gathered saints. Otherwise, the "universal" church ends up being a static people, never fulfilling what God has commanded His people (the exact opposite of the beauty of the universal church).

In fact, of the 109 times the word, "church" is used in the NT, 93 of those are clear references to a **local** church! This shows the importance of belonging to a local church.

Now, what **are** those commands I refer to? The "one another"s of course!

## "One Another"s of a Church

The "one another"s in the NT are simply, what you would do with _one another_ in a local church setting. There are a lot, and I don't intend to list them all here (you can easily look them up), but the point I want to drive home in this section is that a church isn't just "something you attend on Sundays", but rather, are a specific group of people that you carry out the "one another"s with.

For example, from just two verses in Colossians 3, we get the following:

- Bear with one another ([Col. 3:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians+3%3A13&version=ESV))
- Forgive each other ([Col. 3:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians+3%3A13&version=ESV))
- Teach one another ([Col. 3:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians+3%3A16&version=ESV))
- Admonish one another ([Col. 3:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians+3%3A16&version=ESV))

Depending on the list you refer to, there are somewhere between 20 to 30 "one another"s, with at least 50 references to different passages. There's a lot.

Now I highlight one important thing: the people you do the "one another"s with. Notice throughout the Scriptures that **there is no qualifier** for the people that you do the "one another"s with, apart from them being a fellow Christian. In other words, **your personal preference for people doesn't matter**. It's not about whether or not you're drawn to particular people, share more hobbies with them, or are more comfortable around them. In fact, when the "one another"s are lived out in spite of differences between church members, the church becomes all the more beautiful, and her testament to God's goodness is even greater!

# Application & Resources

As we saw from Scripture, solid churches look like ones that are grounded in doctrine (and working towards refining it to be more and more pure), growing in love for Jesus and for one another, and have clung to Christ in the midst of persecution/tribulation. Solid churches are ones that are actively living out the "one another"s of scripture.

I like to break this down into two things: preaching and community.

## Preaching

The first aspect I'd like to consider is the preaching. Is the preaching theologically sound? Has the church kept false teaching from reaching the pulpit? If there is no solid, grounded preaching, then the church believes a different gospel, a different Jesus, and therefore, there is no point in gathering. I've gone on a fair bit already, but I'll briefly mention that Allen Parr on YouTube made a wonderful video where he talks about the differences between **heresy, error, and disagreement**, and how that is addressed in controversial doctrines (e.g., Calvinism vs. Arminianism). I highly recommend checking it out: [7 Controversial Doctrines Christians Need to Stop Arguing About Now!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATQagxttAnY)

Great preaching is meant to move both our hearts and minds. It should bring us to a greater, multi-faceted understanding of God, and knowledge of our own sin. It should bring us to a deep conviction of our sin, a terror and reverence of God, and deeper affection for God because of His mercy and love! The **role of the preacher** is to, as [Ephesians 3:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+3%3A8&version=ESV) says, **preach the unsearchable riches of Christ**.

Personally speaking, I like to look for expositional preaching, as I find that it is often richer than other styles. That isn't to say that topical preaching is bad. If done well, topical preaching is just as good and also necessary! Expositional preaching in particular highlights the richness of scripture itself, which is a wonderful treat in itself. But, you're allowed to have preferences on preaching styles! My preferences have changed over the years of following Jesus. I don't absolutely hate what I listened to before, as I believe it has some level of merit (and of course, preaches the core message of the gospel), and I'm glad for it. Looking back, I'm also just as glad I've matured and learned to appreciate richer preaching. The point is, **you're allowed to have preference in preaching styles, so long as the preaching is grounded in Scripture** (though I myself would definitely do a double-take if there is a pattern of topical preaching that is purely seeker-friendly in style).

## Community

The second aspect I'd consider is the community. Is the community actively living out the "one anothers"? Do they gather together outside of just Sundays to do so? Are there opportunities for you to serve? The community should be drawn towards applying the implications of what they hear on Sunday, to every other day of their lives.

## 15 Questions to Ask

I think these first two things are a great starting point for evaluating a church. But, I highly recommend that you take a look at this list of [15 questions to ask when searching for a church](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F3OcTqZMbZgNbRTZGjJarCWLY4j9N5NpQSqK_YbLEgc/edit?usp=drive_link) (courtesy of Downtown Cornerstone Church).

I will say in addition to this list, that you should take your time to get to know the church! Finding a church isn't the easiest, as it takes time to understand what goes on in a church. You won't know enough about the church on the first week you visit, so take your time! Set aside perhaps one or two months to really get to know what goes on (and don't take too long as well, as that drags you down). Perhaps research the church ahead of time by listening to their sermons (oh, the wonders of modern technology!), or see what groups meet outside of Sunday.

## New City, New Church, New Home

Often, you're looking for a church because you just moved. Whether that's because of work, school, or other things, it's important to plug in!

While I was abroad in Seattle, I found it so joyful to be connected to a solid church so quickly! While I was there, DCC (the church I attended) was going through a [topical series on the church](https://www.downtowncornerstone.org/the-church-series). I found it to be so helpful in my understanding of the church, and I highly recommend you give it a listen!

I also [wrote a blog about my time in Seattle](2023-05-20-a-city-called-seattle.md) a while back, if you'd like to hear the more personal side of my story.

## On Membership: Making it official

The topic of membership and its importance was something I learned about while at DCC. Some may roll their eyes at the idea of an "official membership" (I did as well), but it's really what we see in Scripture! People not only "attend" a church, but they **belong** (read, make a covenant with the other members of the church, to carry out their commitments (e.g., "one another"s) faithfully) to a church.

I have started to take membership seriously (and am in the process of becoming a member as this is being written). If you'd like to ask more questions about my thought processes (this article is already so long...), please reach out, and I'd be happy to share!

The following resources are very helpful for understanding church membership. I'd take a look!
