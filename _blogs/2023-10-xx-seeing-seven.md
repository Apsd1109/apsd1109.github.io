In the book of Revelation, John, the author of the book, has extensive visions of being in heaven, interacting with Jesus, angels, and other heavenly beings. In chapters two and three, Jesus addresses seven churches: He commends, rebukes, exhorts them to change, and provides both consequences and promises for those who don't and do change. What Jesus says to those seven churches can tell us a lot about how we should see (and evaluate) churches. Even across the entire New Testament, we can see both positive and negative examples of what solid churches look like, and those help us decide what church to take part in and belong to, no matter where we find ourselves.

With this blog, I'll cover a few items, all focusing on how to discern what church to join. Namely, Revelation, NT churches and their "one-anothers", and I'll close off with some more resources.

# Revelation's Seven Churches

## Ephesus: Pure doctrine, yet lacking love

> I know your works, your toil and your patient endurance, and how you cannot bear with those who are evil, but have tested those who call themselves apostles and are not, and found them to be false. I know you are enduring patiently and bearing up for my name’s sake, and you have not grown weary. But I have this against you, that you have abandoned the love you had at first. (Revelation 2:2–4, ESV)

The church in Ephesus was commended for working patiently, being discerning, and keeping their doctrine pure. This is a good thing, as we are recommended to test things according to the word of God. If they are not in line, they are to be thrown out. For allowing false teaching to remain, steers people into sin; and sin, if allowed to fester, destroys absolutely everything.

> Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, for many false prophets have gone out into the world. (1 John 4:1, ESV)
> If anyone teaches a different doctrine and does not agree with the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ and the teaching that accords with godliness, he is puffed up with conceit and understands nothing. He has an unhealthy craving for controversy and for quarrels about words, which produce envy, dissension, slander, evil suspicions, and constant friction among people who are depraved in mind and deprived of the truth, imagining that godliness is a means of gain. (1 Timothy 6:3–5, ESV)
> Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump? Cleanse out the old leaven that you may be a new lump, as you really are unleavened. (1 Corinthians 5:6b–7a, ESV)

However, chasing doctrine solely as a mechanical act of the mind, for the purposes of knowledge in and of itself, is not good. There is no competition for which church has the most correct doctrine, for we are all human, and therefore cannot comprehend the infinite depth of God. That isn't to say, that we should give up completely on having correct doctrine! By no means! In fact, I would say that it is good to be continuously evaluating, dare I say, _reforming ourselves_, according to scripture. Correct doctrine helps us to know God more fully, and therefore, worship Him, and live in right relationship more richly.

What I imagine the church in Ephesus did, was chase after doctrine itself, completely missing the reason why they should keep their doctrine pure. They lost their first love: Jesus Christ Himself! It's a joy to worship God, and sound teaching helps us do that even more greatly!

## Smyrna: Spiritually rich and enduring persecution

> I know your tribulation and your poverty (but you are rich) and the slander of those who say that they are Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan. Do not fear what you are about to suffer. Behold, the devil is about to throw some of you into prison, that you may be tested, and for ten days you will have tribulation. Be faithful unto death, and I will give you the crown of life. (Revelation 2:9–10, ESV)

The church in Smyrna is one of the two churches that Jesus only commends in the book of Revelation. They went through poverty and tribulation, yet endured. So Jesus encourages them to continue to, "be faithful unto death", as He will reward them richly (giving them the crown of life).

> For God, who said, "Let light shine out of darkness," has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. But we have this treasure in jars of clay, to show that the surpassing power belongs to God and not to us. We are afflicted in every way, but not crushed; perplexed, but not driven to despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed; always carrying in the body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be manifested in our bodies. For we who live are always being given over to death for Jesus’ sake, so that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh. (2 Corinthians 4:6–11, ESV)
> But he said to me, "My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness. Therefore I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may rest upon me. (2 Corinthians 12:9, ESV)

A church filled with joyful people is a beauty, but a church filled with broken, yet clinging to Christ is an even greater beauty! God's people aren't uniform in experiences and personalities, instead, what makes the church amazing, is that despite being irregular, broken, and discoloured scraps, we're put together like a mosaic. When you zoom out, you'll see the unifying beauty of God's grace and wisdom! This glorifies God!

> and to bring to light for everyone what is the plan of the mystery hidden for ages in God, who created all things, so that through the church the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places. (Ephesians 3:9–10, ESV)

## Pergamum: Holding to Christ, yet allowed false teaching

> I know where you dwell, where Satan’s throne is. Yet you hold fast my name, and you did not deny my faith even in the days of Antipas my faithful witness, who was killed among you, where Satan dwells. But I have a few things against you: you have some there who hold the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to put a stumbling block before the sons of Israel, so that they might eat food sacrificed to idols and practice sexual immorality. (Revelation 2:13–14, ESV)

The church in Pergamum was commended by Jesus, as they held to Him and didn't deny His name despite severe persecution. Yet, they allowed false teaching to creep into their congregation, tainting the purity of God's people. For the purposes of keeping this brief, I'll refer you back to [the church in Ephesus](#ephesus-pure-doctrine-yet-lacking-love) and [the church in Smyrna](#smyrna-spiritually-rich-and-enduring-persecution) as the church in Pergamum experienced a combination of the two.

## Thyatira: Growing in love, yet tolerating heresy

> I know your works, your love and faith and service and patient endurance, and that your latter works exceed the first. But I have this against you, that you tolerate that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess and is teaching and seducing my servants to practice sexual immorality and to eat food sacrificed to idols. (Revelation 2:19–20, ESV)

The church in Thyatria is like the opposite of [the church in Ephesus](#ephesus-pure-doctrine-yet-lacking-love). They didn't just love, but they **grew in love** (their "latter works exceeded their first"). Solid churches aren't merely filled by the love of God, but they also continuously grow in love.

However, they **tolerated heresy**. Nowadays, there are many "churches" that prop up themselves as being being very welcoming, to the point of allowing heretical teaching run rampant in their church. Continuing on in Revelation 2, Jesus has a special warning for them:

> I gave her time to repent, but she refuses to repent of her sexual immorality. Behold, I will throw her onto a sickbed, and those who commit adultery with her I will throw into great tribulation, unless they repent of her works, and I will strike her children dead. And all the churches will know that I am he who searches mind and heart, and I will give to each of you according to your works. (Revelation 2:21–23, ESV)

The call to action is quite clear, to repent of sin. Being part of a church that is actively **rebelling against God** will not be good for your soul, so stay away!

## Sardis: Lifeless, dead works

> I know your works. You have the reputation of being alive, but you are dead. Wake up, and strengthen what remains and is about to die, for I have not found your works complete in the sight of my God. (Revelation 3:1a–2, ESV)

The church in Sardis is one of two churches which Jesus only rebukes. Jesus gives a stern warning and call to action, "Wake up, and strengthen what remains". What is deceptive of churches like the one in Sardis, is that on the surface, they seem lively (read, full of activity), yet on the inside, within their congregation, they are dead (read, abounding in life). I personally am weary of churches that heavily promote running countless activities to attract people to their church, as what often happens, is that the spiritual liveliness of the congregation is sacrificed. Their reliance on themselves is exalted and their reliance on God is diminished, for they're merely interested in raising their own banner, promoting "a new <INSERT CHURCH NAME OR CITY HERE>", instead of fixing their eyes on **the New Jerusalem**. I won't ramble on anymore, since [I did that in an earlier blog](2023-04-29-when-the-clouds-roll-in.md), sharing my takeaways from a bunch of books on the topic of "ministry in the secular age", which I highly recommend you check out if you are interested in this particular topic.

## Philadelphia: Keeping God's word and never denying Jesus

> I know your works. Behold, I have set before you an open door, which no one is able to shut. I know that you have but little power, and yet you have kept my word and have not denied my name. Behold, I will make those of the synagogue of Satan who say that they are Jews and are not, but lie—behold, I will make them come and bow down before your feet, and they will learn that I have loved you. Because you have kept my word about patient endurance, I will keep you from the hour of trial that is coming on the whole world, to try those who dwell on the earth. (Revelation 3:8–10, ESV)

The church in Philadelphia is another church that Jesus only commends. They have kept to God's word and didn't deny Jesus; they patiently endured. And so Jesus tells them to continue on, and they will be greatly rewarded!

> I am coming soon. Hold fast what you have, so that no one may seize your crown. The one who conquers, I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God. Never shall he go out of it, and I will write on him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which comes down from my God out of heaven, and my own new name. (Revelation 3:11–12, ESV)

## Laodicea: Lukewarm, Wretched

> I know your works: you are neither cold nor hot. Would that you were either cold or hot! So, because you are lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, I will spit you out of my mouth. For you say, I am rich, I have prospered, and I need nothing, not realizing that you are wretched, pitiable, poor, blind, and naked. I counsel you to buy from me gold refined by fire, so that you may be rich, and white garments so that you may clothe yourself and the shame of your nakedness may not be seen, and salve to anoint your eyes, so that you may see. (Revelation 3:15–18, ESV)

The church in Laodicea is the final church that Jesus mentions. This church is the other church that Jesus only rebukes. And the rebuke is very heavy. They are identified as useless (being neither hot, nor cold), full of pride (not relying on God), and blind (not realizing their wretchedness, nakedness). Churches that are useless for the ministry of the gospel are disowned by Jesus (for He will spit them out), which is a very terrible thing (see [Matthew 25:31-46](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+25%3A31-46&version=ESV)).
