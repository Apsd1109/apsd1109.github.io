I am a guy whose life has been transformed by [the gospel of Jesus Christ](#the-gospel). I don't believe it's the things that we do that define our identity, but rather, our core beliefs. And from these core beliefs come the way I live my life. But first, a brief explaination of the gospel.

# The Gospel

I'll explain this very briefly, using the four-movement framework that Jeff Vanderstelt wrote in his book, [_Gospel Fluency_](https://www.gospelfluency.com/). Of course, there is so much to be said here, so feel free to reach out and ask me for more!

## Creation

## Fall

## Redemption

## New Creation
