If you know me, you'll know that I _hate_ writing (okay, maybe hate is a strong word...). Even though it's quite daunting to write, it challenges me to think through and explain my thoughts in a succinct and clear manner. It's both difficult and fun to come up with creative ways to explain my thoughts!  
I tend write articles about [my faith](/about), as a way of just thinking through interesting topics, themes, or just things I'm learning.  
I also blog for [UWCCF](https://medium.com/uwccf) occasionally (and sometimes there are exclusives over there)!
