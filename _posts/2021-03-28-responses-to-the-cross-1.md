The crowds gathered in front of the city, singing to him  
“Hosanna!  
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!  
Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David!  
Hosanna in the highest heaven!”

But who is this man really?  
In place of a chariot and an army,  
He comes riding on a donkey!  
How can this man truly free us from our Roman oppressors?

He dares to blaspheme, to call himself God!  
This man is definitely not the messiah we are looking for.

How often is it that we become critical of God?  
Thinking that if He doesn’t fit  
The way we see things, the way we want things to be,  
We may as well reject him?

Jesus is the one who flipped the script.  
His kingdom is the place where,  
Receiving honour is not done by exalting ourselves, but by humbly serving.  
Gaining wealth is done by giving it all away.  
Forgiveness is above revenge.  
Love triumphs over fear.

God help us see,  
Not how you can fit and please us,  
But rather,  
How we can fit and please you.  
To love your kingdom and to live it out.
